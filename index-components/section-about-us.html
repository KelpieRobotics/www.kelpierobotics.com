            <h3>Welcome to Kelpie Robotics Web Page</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
                Kelpie Robotics is made up of undergraduate engineering students passionate about applying their learning to the seas. Through participation in the annual MATE-ROV competition, we apply our learning, design new solutions, and challenge ourselves to build a truly exceptional underwater ROV. We pride ourselves on being a student-run team, developing a strong culture of collaboration, and enhancing the post-secondary experience for our members.

                The oceans were a constant source of fascination for many of our members. Even more than that was the impact of the deep blue on society. Humans extensively manipulate and explore marine environments, from dredging rivers to deploying fishnets to surveying seafloors. Kelpie Robotics was thus founded to appreciate and investigate these phenomena. We hope that you'll enjoy our journey as much as we do.

                    Kelpie Robotics is a team reliant on the passion of its members. Within a week of conception, a rough working prototype made by the team was deployed into a marine environment and operated successfully. With official club status at the University of Ottawa, weâ€™re looking forward to our first competitive season, where our ROV will be competing against those from other institutions around the world. This year, the competition will be held in Long Beach, California.
