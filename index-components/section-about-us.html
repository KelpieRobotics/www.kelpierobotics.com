            <p class="fst-italic">
                Here at Kelpie Robotics, we pride
                ourselves in giving ROV building our best shot. Our team consists of students from various degress, and
                with our combined skills, form a well rounded team.

                <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>We have interests in developing the necessary equipment for
                    underwater deployment</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>And we have interests in the logistics of running a team that
                    deals with underwater robotics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The whole team started off with a small group of students
 who decided to get together and pitch the idea of an underwater 
robotics team to the university. This involved rapidly developing and 
testing a prototype unit which took about a week, and then successfully 
pool testing it. Following this and a few logistics issues, the 
University allowed the team to be officially formed leading us to today.
