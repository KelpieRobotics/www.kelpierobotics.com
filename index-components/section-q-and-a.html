          An ROV is a Remotely Operated Vehicle which is normally sent 
          into environments that a person can not go to. This could be anywhere 
          from the darkest depths of the ocean to the surface of Mars. It consists
           of a robotic vehicle that is designed to be controlled by a human, and 
          is typically equiped with video cameras, and mechanical attachments to 
          accomplish the designated task.

          Keplie Robotics competes in the MATE ROV competition which is
          designed to get students to think and apply STEM concepts in a real 
         life scenaria. This is done through a specially crafted set of tasks 
         that the teams need to plan around, and build their rov for.

          The purpose of the ROV is to allow a person to explore places
 that are dangerous to humans. This makes it safe for exploration since 
the human pilot will never be in the area of danger, but will instead be
 piloting the ROV from a distance. In this case, that would be 
underwater. An enviroment that is dangerous to people for obvious 
reasons.
