          An ROV is a Remotely Operated Vehicle which is normally sent into hostile environments for humans. This could be anywhere from the darkest depths of the ocean to the surface of Mars. It consists of a robotic vehicle remotely controlled by a human, and is typically equipped with video cameras, and mechanical attachments to accomplish the designated task.

          The purpose of the ROV is to allow for exploration of difficult environments without compromising human operator safety and at a lower cost. Submersible ROVs, for example, can replace divers in certain scenarios.
